# CS 131 Fall 2024 Project 1

No  know bugs, all good!!

# Project walkthrough: 
In this project, I mainly followed the pseudocode in the spec, and used the AST provided. Some issues I ran into were getting mixed up with .elem_type and .name as well as understanding the structure of the AST. Once I understood the structure, it was a lot smoother to code the whole thing.
